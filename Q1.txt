Python Loop:- It is defined as the executing of function or statement for a given amount of times. 
ex:- We want to print "Hello World!" 5 times, So we have to there are two options to do that:-
     1. Either we will print the statement 5 times and waste our time or
     2. We will do with loops which will save or time and line of code.

There are basically 3 types of loops in Python:-
1. For loop :- The structure of for loop is 
                for(condition){
                    //statement
                }


2. while loop :- The structure of while loop is 
                 while{
                    //statement
                 }(condition);

3. do while :- The structure of while loop is 
                while{
                    //structure
                } 
                do(condition)
